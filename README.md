Date created 16/10/2019 Project Title US Bikeshare Project

Description of past decade, bike-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. 

Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. 

This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it to point B, though they can also return it to same location if they would like to just go for a ride.

Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

These technologies also provide a huge amounts of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

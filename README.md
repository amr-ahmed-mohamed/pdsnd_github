Description of past decade, bike-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. 

Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. 

This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it to point B, though they can also return it to same location if they would like to just go for a ride.

Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

These technologies also provide a huge amounts of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

Files used :
 1- chicago.csv 
 2- new_york_city.csv 
 3- washington.csv


Programming Language used python 3.7

Description Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world.

Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price.

This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B,

though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. 

These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
